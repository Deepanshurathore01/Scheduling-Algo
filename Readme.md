# CPU Scheduling Simulator

A comprehensive simulation of various CPU scheduling algorithms implemented in C++. This project helps developers and students understand the behavior and differences between scheduling strategies like FCFS, SJF, Priority Scheduling, and Round Robin.

---

## Features ‚ú®

- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS):** Processes are executed in the order they arrive.
- **Shortest Job First (SJF):** Executes processes with the shortest burst time first.
- **Priority Scheduling:** Executes processes based on their priority levels.
- **Round Robin (RR):** Time-sliced scheduling for fair execution.

### Key Metrics Calculated:
- **Start Time**
- **Finish Time**
- **Turnaround Time**
- **Waiting Time**
- **Response Time**

## How to Run üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites:
- **C++ Compiler:** Ensure you have `g++` or any other standard C++ compiler installed.

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Deepanshurathore01/Scheduling-Algo.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

  cd ShedulingAlogorithms
  
3. Compile the program:

   g++ scheduling_simulator.cpp -o scheduling_simulator
   
4. Run the executable:

bash
Copy code
./scheduling_simulator






Usage üìö
Input Process Details:

Enter the number of processes.
For each process, provide:
Process ID
Arrival Time
Burst Time
Priority (optional for certain algorithms).
Choose a Scheduling Algorithm:

Enter the choice:
1 for FCFS
2 for SJF
3 for Priority Scheduling
4 for Round Robin
View the Output:

The program displays:
Scheduling Gantt chart
Per-process metrics
Average Turnaround Time
Average Waiting Time

   
Example Input/Output üñ•Ô∏è
Input:

Enter the number of processes: 3
Enter process ID, arrival time, burst time, and priority for process 1: 1 0 5 2
Enter process ID, arrival time, burst time, and priority for process 2: 2 2 3 1
Enter process ID, arrival time, burst time, and priority for process 3: 3 4 1 3

Enter algorithm choice (1-4), 0 to Exit:
1. FCFS
2. SJF
3. Priority
4. Round Robin
0. Exit
Enter your choice: 2
Output:

SJF Scheduling:

Average Turnaround Time: 5.33
Average Waiting Time: 2.33


Algorithms Overview üöÄ
First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
Order of Execution: Based on arrival time.
Non-Preemptive.

Shortest Job First (SJF)
Order of Execution: Shortest burst time first.
Non-Preemptive.

Priority Scheduling
Order of Execution: Highest priority first.
Preemptive or Non-Preemptive (depends on implementation).

Round Robin (RR)
Order of Execution: Time-sliced execution in a cyclic order.
Preemptive.
